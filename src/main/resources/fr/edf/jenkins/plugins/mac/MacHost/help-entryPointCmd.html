<div>
    <p>Sets the commands passed to the user before the launch of the
        agent.</p>
    <p>This field is a multi-line string. Each (non-empty) line defines
        a separate argument. If you require more than one argument then you
        will need to expand the field, otherwise you'll end up with one long
        line instead of multiple lines.</p>
    <p>If this field is left blank then nothing will be set before
        launch the agent</p>
